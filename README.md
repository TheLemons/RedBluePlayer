# RedBluePlayer
Basically just my dabblings on a bot to play Pokemon Red and Blue (emulated, of course). I won't be providing anything that is not copyright protected (as the ROM files or any sprite data) or anything that's not mine (such as the emulator).

The current plan is to write my own portions and add it to the VisualBoyAdvance-M emulator either compiled into it or as a shared library. I will add a website later describing my work and what I plan to do next.

My code probably sucks. That's okay. If it's good, feel free to enjoy. If it's bad, feel free to laugh.
